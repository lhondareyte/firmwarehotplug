[README]

This directory contains USB-MIDI complient firmware for the EZUSB chip
(AN2131SC) developed to make USB-MIDI adaptors run with Linux.

The firmware is known to support the following hardware:
- MidiSportUNO (Midiman) : operational (= 1x1)
- MidiSport1x1 (Midiman) : operational
- MidiSport2x2 (Midiman) : operational
- USB-2-MIDI (Steinberg) : operational (= 2x2)
- MidiSport4x4 (Midiman) : first two ports operational, no leds, work in progress
- MidiSport8x8 (Midiman) : unknown, perhaps like 4x4

There are two, complete different versions of the firmware, the "original"
(or version 1) and the "unified" (or version 2).

As the version numbers propose, the unified version is much newer and ways
better, but in the moment, only intented for developers. Consider it the
unstable branch.

The original branch should be your preference if you simply want to get
your devices going.
