[README]

This program is a USB-MIDI complient firmware for the EZUSB chip
(AN2131SC) developed to makes a MidiSport1x1 USB-MIDI adaptor run
with Linux.

See ezusbmidi.pdf for more informations.

This is the "Stable" and "Original" branch of the software.

If you plainly want to make your device run, this is the right stuff.

There are still known issues, but finalizing this branch has highest
priority and work on the Unified branch will not continue until we're
sure that the devices listed below work fine with both ALSA and OSS
drivers under all circumstances.


The firmware is known to support the following hardware:
- MidiSportUNO (Midiman) : operational? (== 1x1)
- MidiSport1x1 (Midiman) : operational
- MidiSport2x2 (Midiman) : operational
- USB-2-MIDI (Steinberg) : operational  (== 2x2)
- MidiSport4x4 (Midiman) : first two ports, no leds, work in progress
- MidiSport8x8 (Midiman) : unknown

Chances are, that other EZUSB based MIDI adaptors work to some
degree with other hardware, too. See the documentation for more
information.
