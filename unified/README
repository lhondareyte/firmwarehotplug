NOTE: You'll normally prefere to try the "Original" branch

-----------------------------

The material in this directory is supposed for developers,
though you might be able to run it with some success.

If you are a developer you will prefere to have a look in
here as the code examplifies virtual all of the EZUSB chips
abilities.

The code currently sufferes mainly from some not yet identified
bottlenecks, which dramatically reduce the speed. As soon as
these are tracked down, the unified driver will become the
prefered one for the devices listed below.

Contrary to the "Original" branch, a unified firmware is used
for all different devices, performing an device recognition
process reading informations from the serial rom over the I2C bus.

-----------------------------

This program is a USB-MIDI complient firmware for the EZUSB chip
(AN2131SC) developed to make USB-MIDI adaptors run with Linux.

The firmware is known to support the following hardware:
- MidiSportUNO (Midiman) : operational? (== 1x1)
- MidiSport1x1 (Midiman) : operational
- MidiSport2x2 (Midiman) : operational
- USB-2-MIDI (Steinberg) : operational  (== 2x2)
- MidiSport4x4 (Midiman) : first two ports, no leds, work in progress
- MidiSport8x8 (Midiman) : unknown

Chances are, that other EZUSB based MIDI adaptors work to some
degree with other hardware, too. See the documentation for more
information.
